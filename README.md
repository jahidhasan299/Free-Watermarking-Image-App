# Free-Watermarking-Image-App

# The Steps to solve the problem:
1. Loading the image and logo form url's.
2. Resizing the images
3. Converting images into RGB format and then convert it into numpy array.
4. Storing the height and width of the image and logo
5. Finding the coornidates of the center of the image.
6. Finding out the region of interest to draw logo.
7. Merging the logo with the image and visualizing it.
8. Creating the text Watermark.
9. Using CV2 function to define thext properties and applying it at specific coordinates.
10. Converting the image into RGB and Visualizing it.

# Useful of Image_Watermarking
1. Adding a watermarking to an image works as copyright. Different organizations can use it to make their content secure so that their content cannot be misused without their licence or a paid version. In this project, We will saw how easily we can use OpenCV to add watermarks to our images.
